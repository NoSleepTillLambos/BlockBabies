## Concept Process

<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->

**My main source of inspiration was drawn from Axie infinity, so a lot of my inspiration was designed around them and their website and agenda** 

**I have quite a lot of experience using and a lot of time within the app so it helped a lot with my designs and the way in which i wanted people to naviagte through the app**

### Road Map and conceptual process üìå

**Planning the crafting section and the inner workins regarding route protection and authentication to ensure the inventories are protected**

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process üî®

**A large part of my inspiration came from axie infinity and its marketplace where users could breed, buy and sell their axies**
<a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie infinity</a>
**I had to decide what my project was going to be based on and what the general theme would be. <br/> from playing Axie a lot
and with the general idea being the same as what was expected of us in the brief i decided to base it off this**

### Implementation Process ‚úíÔ∏è 

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->
- **Research/ design and inspiration work, what did i want to create, what did i find cool and inspiring**
- **I wanted it to be based off something real world orientated**
- **Wireframing and exploration of possible UI's**
- **Working with a whole new framework was tough so learning the ins and outs before development was essential it definentely took longer than expected**
- **I went back and reimplemented a lot of the UI elements and functionality** 

#### Above And Beyond the brief üåû

<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->

- **Search | toggle functionality for the location and inventory screens where users could find the exact element they wanted**

### Future Implementation ‚åõ

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- **In the future i would love to incorporate real world blockchain technology and maintain users funds**
