### Project Description

Algo crypt is a crypto currency web application designed to provide users with the ability to analyze various price points and historical data about the top 5 currencies by market cap, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, USDT etc

### Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [CoinLore](https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api)
- [Material UI V4](https://v4.mui.com/)

<!-- FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY-->
<!-- You can add the links to all of your imagery at the bottom of the file as references -->

## Features and Functionality

<!-- note how you can use your gitHub link. Just make a path to your assets folder -->

![image2](src/Assets/Liam_Wedge_21100218_HomePage.png)

### Feature 2

The features of this page include a doughnut chart, a bar graph displaying the market cap of the crypto Currency's in question and finally a polar area graph displaying the total market caps

### Feature 3

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->

## Concept Process

Pintrest was my main source of inspiration, as a first time react user i brought in different aspects from a variety of sources and shaped them into something that would work well with an API. Something that users could engage with and latch onto.

### Road Map and conceptual process

![image6](src/Assets/wireframe3.png)

### Custom UI

The custom UI I made use of was provided by CoinPonent, the UI banner sits at the top of my web application and provides the user with market movement and updates surrounding the Crpyto ecosystem

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->

## Development Process

Users are able to cycle through various currencies on the comparison and timeline page and display data about the various object properties all with help of the Coinlore API.

### Implementation Process

<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

- Utilized React `Charts.JS` dependency for Data visualization
- Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
- API End Point: https://api.coinlore.net/api/global/
- Ticker and plugins were achieved with the help of: https://coinponent.com/crypto-converter-widget

#### Above And Beyond

Going above and beyond the brief

<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->

- I explored the use of Material UI as a way to implement a cleaner and more visually appealing front end .
- Through the use of CoinPonent I implemented a coin ticker bar.
- Explain your understanding and execution of above skill.

### Future Implementation

<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

- In the future i would like to get my timeline page fully functioning as i was not quite able to complete it due to time restrictions
- I would like to actually implement a way for users to access the blockchain (I'm aiming high) through my website and possibly even
  make transactions, who knows!.
